storyline: >
    A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond on a rogue mission to 
    Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia, the beautiful and 
    forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting 
    and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. 
    Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh, the new head of the Centre of 
    National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of
    MI6 led by M. Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny and Q to help him seek 
    out Madeleine Swann, the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White, who may
    hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of 
    the assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond 
    ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns a chilling connection 
    between himself and the enemy he seeks.
