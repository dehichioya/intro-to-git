# YAML Basic Syntax
# -----------------
#
#   YAML syntax is white-space sensitive.

# comments in YAML starts with hashtag
# like this

# typical structure:
#   key: value

# scalar variables
integer: 42
string: "this is a string"
float: 3.14
boolean: true

# lists can be defined using "-" on each newline
books:
  - "Les Miserable"
  - "Pride & Prejudice"

# or within []
names: ["John", "Joe", "Josh"]

# mappings/dictionary
character:
  callsign: blackwidow
  role: melee
  name: "natasha romanoff"
  skills:
    - "tactician"
    - "martial artist"
    - "marksman"

# mapping/dictionary type can also be represented using {}
character: {callsign: blackwidow, role: melee}

# long strings, use | to preserve newlines and spaces
long_string_with_newlines: |
  text in here will
  appear as it is typed
  and the newlines will be preserved,
  just like a haiku

long_one_liner_string: >
  this is a very long string where,
  no matter how many lines I put it over,
  it will print out to be a single line,
  because with >, newlines are not 
  preserved.
